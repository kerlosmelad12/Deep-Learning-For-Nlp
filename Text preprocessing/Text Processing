-Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a crucial step before any NLP project. It improves text quality, reduces noise, and ensures better model performance.

- Cleaning Phase

In this phase, we clean the text by removing words or symbols that carry little or no meaningful information:

1- Stop Words Removal

Stop Words are very common words like the, is, and, in that usually do not add semantic value.
Removing them helps to:

Reduce text size

Improve model efficiency

Focus on meaningful words

2- Frequent Words Removal

Frequent Words are words that appear very often even after stop words removal.
These words can dominate the text and reduce the impact of informative words.
Removing them helps to:

Reduce noise

Avoid model bias toward common words

Highlight important information

3- Rare Words Removal

Rare Words are words that appear only once or twice in the entire corpus.
These words often:

Increase sparsity

Expand the vocabulary unnecessarily

Add noise instead of useful information
